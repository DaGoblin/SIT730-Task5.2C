SITE730 Task 5.2C Raspberry Pi Advanced GUI

We create a slightly more advanced GUI using pyqt5, consisting of 3 sliders, spin boxes and buttons.
Using PWM we can control the brightness of the LED, by moving each of the red green and blue sliders. 
The spin boxes are used to set countdown timers which dim the LEDs until the timer reaches zero.
three radio buttons toggle LED running on Raspberry Pi pins.
